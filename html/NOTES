1. pick route and direction
2. show stop list + map of all stops

    pick from text list or from map  

    deal with problem of spurs later
      spurs means the map is a better interface for selecting stops
  
3. pick start and end stops
4. show trips covering that pair of stops & times
  
    two columns, showing start and arrival

    map: big circles for start and end, color coded same as in #2



Step 2:

  calculate all stops (with locations), shapes for route and direction. 

Don't calculate trips data set until step 4.


select stop_id, stop_code, stop_name, stop_lat, stop_lon, trip_id, arrival_time, stop_sequence from route_stops_today('1', 0) as (stop_id varchar, stop_code varchar, stop_name varchar, stop_lat double precision, stop_lon double prec
ision, trip_id varchar, arrival_time varchar, stop_sequence integer);

EM for trips view? to update realtime



 trip_id  |                s1_name                 | s1_arrives | s1_seq |          s2_name           | s2_arrives | s2_seq





select
  trips.trip_id,

  (select stop_name from stops where stop_id = '70040') s1_name,
  st1.arrival_time s1_arrives,
  st1.stop_sequence s1_seq,

  (select stop_name from stops where stop_id = '70048') s2_name,
  st2.arrival_time s2_arrives,
  st2.stop_sequence s2_seq

from trips
  inner join stop_times st1 using (trip_id)
  inner join stop_times st2 using (trip_id)


where trips.trip_id in (select trip_id from route_trips_today('Blue Line', 1))
  and st1.stop_id = '70040'
  and st2.stop_id = '70048'

  order by st1.arrival_time;



1. keep all on one page
2. when 2 stops checked, hide other stops, show next arrivals
3. when < 2 stops checked, show all stop choices
4. show time frame around now?
5. websockets? a channel is one route, dir, + 2 stops
6. google map resize and pan 

- cache the route selector data ahead of time; make switching fast

Make it possible to overlay an abritrary set of routes, so that user can
compare for example red line vs bus 1. Also seen when routes
interconnect.

Instead of schedule tables, use a playhead to show movement of
scheduled.  Try using the playhead interface as the main controller.

If we use a slider to represent time the paradigm changes. The slider
itself could move forward with time by itself. But user can take control
and move it forward. (Backward doesn't really make sense)?

Does this make any sense?

The other possibility is to just focus on trips and put a grid on the
right? Doesn't work well for spurs.


Slider. Move elements on left, trips on right 

Show one box per "active" trip at time x, and show next stop predicted
or scheduled arrival time. Change this box as the vehicle passes it as
the slider moves.

What's the object model?

primary variable parameters:

  route, direction, time
