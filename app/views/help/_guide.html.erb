    <p>
    Here is a guide to what the colored pins in the map view mean:
    </p>


    <table class='pin'>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <%=image_tag 'map/PinDown1.png' %>
        </td>
        <td>
            A red pin is a stop. You can tap on any pin to show the stop name and the next few arrival times. If there are no more arrivals for the day, you'll see a message saying so. 
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <%=image_tag 'map/PinDown1Green.png' %>
        </td>
        <td>
          A green pin is the starting point of a trip. A route might have more than one starting point if trips start from different places at different times of the day.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <%=image_tag 'map/PinDown1Purple.png' %>
        </td>
        <td>
            A purple pin is a stop where a <%= @transport_type.downcase %> is
            just about to arrive according to the MBTA schedule or according to the real-time data feed if available. You can take
            this as a rough indicator of where a <%= @transport_type.downcase %> 
            is, or at least should be. 

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <%=image_tag 'map/TrackingDot.png' %>
        </td>
        <td>
          If you've allowed the app to use your iPhone's location, a blue dot
          will drop onto the map showing your current location if it's close
          to the route or the line you're looking at.
          When the blue dot appears, <strong>the pin for the nearest stop</strong>
          should automatically show its callout with next arrival times.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
