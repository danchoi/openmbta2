<h1>OpenMBTA</h1>

<p>
OpenMBTA is a set of tools, many of them open-source, for delivering public
transit schedules and real-time data to commuters in the Boston metro area.
OpenMBTA is being actively developed for Bostonians by Bostonians, with a lot
of help and encouragement from our first-rate public servants at the MBTA.
