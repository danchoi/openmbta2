JQuery: Playing with Select (DropDownList/ComboBox)

   July 1st, 2009

   Why oh why did the HTML overlords call their Combo Box/DropDownList a
   SELECT?  Then call the items in the list OPTIONS?  It isn’t like there
   weren’t a plethora of other names for the widget.  Then it could have been
   consistent anyway.

   Oh well.

   It seams that each time I start a new project I have to relearn how to
   grab values out of a DropDownList – I mean “select element”.  Anyway, I’m
   trying to get this down before I go nuts and have to learn it all over
   again.

Basic Select

   First off, here is the basic html I’m talking about:

    1: <select id="ComboBox" >

    2:       <option value="1">Value 1</option>

    3:       <option value="2">Value 2</option>

    4:       <option value="3">Value 3</option>

    5:       <option value="4">Value 4</option>

    6:       <optgroup label="Group1">

    7:         <option value="5">Value 5</option>

    8:         <option value="6">Value 6</option>

    9:         <option value="7">Value 7</option>

   10:         <option value="8">Value 8</option>

   11:       </optgroup>

   12:     </select>

   [[34]_______]

   Nice and simple.  Now, the basic things you want to do with said select
   statement:

   1. Get the value of the selected item.

   2. Get the text of the selected item.

   3. Find out when the value changed

   4. Programmatically set the selected item.

   5. Modify the list.

   Most of those are very easy with JQuery, but one is slightly strange. Lets
   go through these one by one:

1. Get the value of the selected item

   This is the easiest.  Use the val method.  All done.

    1: $("#ComboBox").val()

2. Get the text of the selected item

   You would think this would be easy as well, but it isn’t.  You cannot just
   use the text() method on the combobox.  That will give you the text values
   of all of the options in a single string.  Not what you want.  The trick
   is to use the :selected query modifier on the option.

    1: $("#ComboBox option:selected").text()

   Now, you might be tempted to use the ‘>’ (means direct descendent of)
   between the #ComboBox and the option — don’t.  If you look at my example
   above, that code will only work for options not in optgroup nodes.

3. Find out when the select value changed

   This is also rather easy with JQuery.

    1: $("#ComboBox").change(function() { /* do something here */ });

4. Programmatically set the selected item.

    1: $("#ComboBox").val(2);

5. Modify the list.

   Modifying a select element is not fundamentally different than modifying
   any other element in the dom, but there are a few basics here to keep in
   mind. Mainly: try to avoid using the dom directly.  Create html strings
   instead.

   Clear the list:   $(“#ComboBox”).html(“”);

   Add to the list: $(“<option value=’9’>Value
   9</option>”).appendTo(“#ComboBox”);

   Simple as that.

       Nice tips.

       You say “try to avoid using the dom directly” — why?

       Other gotchas of select boxes: select that allows multiple selected
       options behaves differently.

       Also, the val() of an option that does not have a “value” attribute is
       the the text() string.

       The reason it’s called “select” instead of a “DropDownList” is a)
       Microsoft, thankfully, doesn’t get to name things all the time, and b)
       HTML is supposed to be presentation independent. Calling it “select”
       allows the client to display the list of options however they want.
       Same reason that “i” and “b” are deprecated in favor of “em” and
       “strong.”

       Hi,

       I am looking for a way to trigger a dropdown to clear any value that
       has been selected from it, so it returns to its default state where
       nothing is selected.

       The best way i’ve found to achieve this is to prepend a blank option
       to the dropdown and then select that blank option:

       $(“#dropdown”).prepend(“”);
       $(“#dropdown option:first-child”).attr(“selected”,”selected”);

       But ideally I would prefer not to have a blank option in the dropdown
       selector so that I dont have to validate the user to ensure they are
       not submitting a blank value.

       What i’m wondering is if there is a simple way to tell the dropdown to
       return to the state where nothing is selected, e.g. if there was
       something like (“#dropdown”).reset – any ideas?

     * Mark Puddephatt

       [36]@Mark Puddephatt

       Whoop a bit of my script seems to have got lost, it should be:

       $(“#dropdown”).prepend(“”);
       $(“#dropdown option:first-child”).attr(“selected”,”selected”);

       (without the spaces on the option tags)

     * Mark Puddephatt

       OK sorry about this, but the comments box doesnt like html code! But
       the prepend has an option tag inside the quotes…

     * http://www.elegantcode.com Chris Brandsma

       @mark, as far as I know, a dropdown ALWAYS has a selected item. By
       default it is the first item in the list. So your dropdown needs a
       blank item in it if you want a ‘nonselected’ option.

       The alternative is to not use a dropdown at all. Instead use a textbox
       that links to a hidden div that dispalys when the textbox is
       selected/clicked. The JQuery Calendar control does this.

       Hi, I’m french and i have a problem. Maybe coud you help me.

       how can we remove certain options from Select list based on the text
       value of that option ?

       (note: it is not just the selected option , but some of the options
       need to be removed based on the text)

       e.g. I want to remove options that have the text starting with *

       *one*
       two
       three
       *four*

       I have only just started with jQuery but this may work for you:

       $(‘#tryit option’).each(function(){ if($(this).text().indexOf(‘*’) >
       -1) $(‘#tryit option’).remove(‘:contains(“‘ + $(this).text() + ‘”)’);
       });

       You may want to try that, i haven’t tested it, but from the
       documentation it says it should work.

       thank you so much – you will master jquery pretty well – this code
       just worked sweeeet!

       Part 5 – Modify the list:

       For “Clear the list”, this would suffice: $(“#ComboBox”).empty();

       Hello Chris,

       I have been trying to implement the nice tips in your tutorial to
       resolve a dropdown problem.I am using jquery.validate.js plugin.

       I hope you can help me with me this.

       How do I make one element required based upon a dropdown list’s
       selected OPTION?

       ex:

       Please note that the select and the textbox are arrays. I have
       addNewRow and DeleteRow methods to dynamically add/delete rows.
       ___________________________________________________
       Books and Titles 

       Choose One
       jQuery
       PHP
       Perl
       Other – please specify name

       If “Other – please specify name” is selected, then the input with name
       “otherbook[ ]” must be required.

       I tried as below but it does not work:

       rules:{
       “otherbook[]“: {
       required: function(){
       return $(“#books option:selected”).text()==”Other – please specify
       name”;
       }
       }

       I just can’t figure out how to do this.

       Appreciate your help and thanks in advance.

       Great post!! I’m working on a project requiring this sort of
       functionality. My biggest challenge is going to getting the value from
       multiple dropdown…er “select” boxes based upon class only (dynamically
       generated, so no can’t hard-code id’s). Any thoughts? Thanks.

     * Msvc6

       $(‘#selename,#selname’).live(‘change’,function(){
       if($(‘#selename’).find(‘option:selected’).val()===$(‘#selname
       option:selected’).val()){
       $(‘#myDiv’).text(‘equal’);
       }else $(‘#myDiv’).text(‘not equal’);
       });

        i and b are NOT deprecated in favour of anything, only u is
       deprecated. Which you use depends on the context / situation.

     * Chris Emerson

        Also, the reason it isn’t called DropDownList or anything like that
       is that the select element can have a size, which turns it into a list
       box rather than a drop down list.

     * Anonymous

       Thanks, this is great — simple and to the point. jQuery is amazing.

       Tip:

       if you want to do this on more than one element, rather than
       specifying the ID, just do this:

       $(‘select’).change(function() {
           var selectedOption = $(this).find(‘option:selected’);
           var selectedOptionValue = $(selectedOption).val();
           var selectedOptionText = $(selectedOption).text();
          
           alert(“You selected” + selectedOptionText + “Value: ” +
       selectedOptionValue);
       });

       Or obviously if you just wanted to target only certain dropdowns,
       change first line to:

       $(‘select.className’).
       or
       $(‘#containerElement select’).

       or whatever.

       Hope someone finds this useful.

       Excellent article.  It allowed me to get my select working with jquery
       very quickly.  However, I am lost on one missing item. Is it possible
       to add an optgroup using jquery.  ie. build your example entirely from
       jquery?  My select is geographic areas (countries) that contain
       subgroups (states for instance).  I am starting with an empty select
       and adding everything based on an array of geo objects.

       Hi Chris,
       Code seems simple & straightforward. But I can’t seem to make it work.

       I used
       $(#DropDownList1″).val(2);
       alert(“#DropDownList1″).val());

       The message was undefined. 

       Here is my problem. I need to get StatusCode from Main table, look up
       the Status on StatusDesc Table and show the Description on a dropdown.
       All of this to be done progammatically.  Meaning, I have to pass on
       the StatusCode to the .click function… Simple, I’ve done it in other
       programming languages. But asp.net is killing me. did not work, so I
       turned to jQuery.

       Any insights?
       Thanks in advance!
       Renee

       It lets you “select” an “option” – DropDownList and ComboBox imply
       absolutely nothing about the function of the element.
